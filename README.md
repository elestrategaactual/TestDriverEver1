# PLC and Driver EVER Titanio Connection and BLDC Motor Axis Configuration with TwinCAT

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to establish the communication between a PLC and the EVER Titanio driver using the TwinCAT software. It also covers the initial configuration and testing of an axis driven by a BLDC motor.

### Features:
- Setting up the TwinCAT environment
- Configuring the communication between TwinCAT and EVER Titanio Driver
- Mapping the PLC variables for motor control
- Initial axis setup and parameter tuning for the BLDC motor
- Running basic tests to validate the setup

### Getting Started:
1. **Install TwinCAT**: Ensure that the latest version of TwinCAT is installed and properly licensed.
2. **Connect EVER Titanio Driver**: Follow the wiring diagram to connect the PLC with the EVER Titanio driver.
3. **Configure TwinCAT Project**: 
   - Set up a new project in TwinCAT and establish a connection with the PLC.
   - Add the EVER Titanio driver in the hardware configuration.
4. **BLDC Motor Setup**: 
   - Define the motor parameters, such as pole pairs and rated current.
   - Map the control and feedback signals between the PLC and the driver.
5. **Testing and Tuning**:
   - Execute the first axis movements and perform basic tests.
   - Fine-tune parameters such as speed, acceleration, and current limits.
